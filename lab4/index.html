			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning to use pseudocode in order to faciliate a coding workflow.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Nothing specific to report. It was a little difficult to think about real world actions
						in the form of pseudocode; it was difficult to enumerate tasks into a 
					one-after-the-other format. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This kind of activity is actually really helpful to understand how computers actually work,
						computers can't really do multiple actions at once (at least not in simple programs) and so even 
						in cases where it would make sense in real life to do tasks concurrently, we have to find a way
					to make those tasks seem concurrent while actually doing them one after the other.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output">
						<pre><code id="pseudocode">
// declare variables for P1 and P2

// while there is no winner 
	// print something to P1; print something to P2;
	// get input from P1; get input from P2
	// check P1 move against P2 move using reference.
	// if someone won
		// break 

// print winner
