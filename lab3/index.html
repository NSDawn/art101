					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>As someone with a background in CS, nothing 
						stood out as super challenging, but I remember that the first time 
						I attempted this, it was definitely difficult to follow all the 
						implicit coding 'rules' like "no spaces", "make sure you're telling 
						the computer exactly what it needs to do", that would pull up so many 
						frustrating errors. I took all of this into account when I was helping 
						my partner with the assignment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems that arose were getting the right filepath and 
						getting images to fit in boxes. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I've found that the best way to learn HTML and CSS 
						is to try things willy-nilly and learn all the possible 
						interactions by trial-and-error. This will often serve helpful 
						later, when one thing I accidentally found turns out to actually 
						have been useful. </p>
